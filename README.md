## A library for working with isometries and orthogonal transforms.

Starting with a question on the composition of two rotations (in 2-D and 3-D),
this code was developed to represent isometries and orthogonal transformations.

The emphasis is on using direct geometric methods (rather than, say, matrices)
to model rotations, etc.
